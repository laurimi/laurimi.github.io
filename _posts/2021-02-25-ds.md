I recently appeared on the Data Skeptic podcast to talk about my research into decentralized information gathering and multi-agent active perception. You can check out the podcast and the episode [here](https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2021/decentralized-information-gathering){:target="_blank"}.

For more information about the work discussed, you can read the summary post about the work [here](/research/2020/06/13/active-perception.html). The latest results (as of start of 2021) in this stream of research are discussed [here](/research/2020/10/23/neurips.html).
