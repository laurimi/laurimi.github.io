title: Python API for Dec-POMDP problems in the .dpomdp format
categories: news
---
Decentralized POMDPs are a popular mathematical framework for multiagent sequential decision-making under uncertainty.
The [.dpomdp file format](http://masplan.org/problem_domains){:target="_blank"} for describing Dec-POMDPs has been around for a while, and the only parser for this file format I am aware of comes from the [MADP toolbox](https://github.com/MADPToolbox/MADP){:target="_blank"} written in C++. 

As Python is arguably becoming a more commonly used tool for many computer science researchers in the area of multi-agent decision-making, I decided to write a small Python package to interface with .dpomdp files. The package can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/laurimi/pydpomdp){:target="_blank"}. As of now, the package offers only the barest of functionalities, but I hope it can be useful if you're looking to tackle solving Dec-POMDPs using Python!
