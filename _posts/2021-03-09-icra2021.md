title: Object pose estimation with on-line data synthesis using point clouds at ICRA 2021
categories: news
---
With Ge Gao, Xiaolin Hu, Jianwei Zhang, and Simone Frintrop, we propose an augmented autoencoder based approach for estimating the translation and rotation of objects given point cloud data. 
I am happy to announce that this paper is now accepted for presentation at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2021)!
Interestingly, we show that using *only synthetic data* generated by a simple on-line synthesis method is enough to reach good performance on some challenging datasets.

You can check the [arXiv preprint here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01977){:target="_blank"} for details, and find the implementation of the system [on GitHub](https://github.com/GeeeG/CloudAAE).
Stay tuned for the presentation of the paper at the conference.
