I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Informatics](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en.html){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html){:target="_blank"}.
My research interests include decision-making under uncertainty, active perception, and computer vision.
I develop theory and algorithmic approaches for teams of agents to act cooperatively to accomplish a shared task.
Autonomous robots are an important application area for my research, and I have worked on methods for active information gathering and computer vision for mobile robots in applications such as exploration, object pose estimation, and visual object search.
